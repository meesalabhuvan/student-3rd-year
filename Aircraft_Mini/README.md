✈️ Aircraft Dogfight Simulation (3D)

A Python-based 3D aircraft dogfight simulation that visualizes the dynamic interaction between two aircraft—one pursuing and one evading—using parametric trajectories and real-time animation.

This project is designed for educational and visualization purposes, helping students understand basic concepts of relative motion, pursuit–evasion behavior, and 3D kinematics.

🚀 Project Overview
